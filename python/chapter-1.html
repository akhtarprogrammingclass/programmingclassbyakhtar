<h1 class="text-bg-warning">Section 1.1: Getting Started</h1>
<p class="text-bg-success">
    Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van
Rossum and first released in 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming,
and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.
<br><br>
Two major versions of Python are currently in active use:
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x is the current version and is under active development.</li>
    <li>Python 2.x is the legacy version and will receive only security updates until 2020. No new features will be
        implemented. Note that many projects still use Python 2, although migrating to Python 3 is getting easier.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h6 class="text-bg-danger">Verify if Python is installed</h6>
<p class="text-bg-info">
    To confirm that Python was installed correctly, you can verify that by running the following command in your
favorite terminal (If you are using Windows OS, you need to add path of python to the environment variable before
using it in command prompt): <br> <br>
$ python --version <br>
Python 3.x Version ≥ 3.0 <br> <br>
If you have Python 3 installed, and it is your default version (see Troubleshooting for more details) you should see <br>
something like <this:br></this:br>
$ python --version <br>
Python 3.6.0 <br>
Python 2.x Version ≤ 2.7 <br> <br>
If you have Python 2 installed, and it is your default version (see Troubleshooting for more details) you should see
something like this: <br>
$ python --version <br>
Python 2.7.13 <br> <br>
If you have installed Python 3, but $ python --version outputs a Python 2 version, you also have Python 2
installed. This is often the case on MacOS, and many Linux distributions. Use $ python3 instead to explicitly use the
Python 3 interpreter.

<h4 class="text-bg-secondary">Hello, World in Python using IDLE</h4>
<p>IDLE is a simple editor for Python, that comes bundled with Python.</p>
<h4 class="text-bg-dark">How to create Hello, World program in IDLE</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        Open IDLE on your system of choice.
        <ul>
            <li>In older versions of Windows, it can be found at All Programs under the Windows menu.</li>
            <li>In Windows 8+, search for IDLE or find it in the apps that are present in your system.</li>
            <li>On Unix-based (including Mac) systems you can open it from the shell by typing $ idle
                python_file.py.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It will open a shell with options along the top.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the shell, there is a prompt of three right angle brackets:</strong></p>
<p class="text-bg-secondary">>>></p>
<p>Now write the following code in the prompt:</p>
<p class="text-bg-secondary">>>> print("Hello, World")</p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p class="text-bg-secondary">>>> print("Hello, World") <br>
    Hello, World</p>
    <h6><strong>Hello World Python file</strong></h6>
    <p>
        Create a new file hello.py that contains the following line: <br>   
Python 3.x Version ≥ 3.0
    </p>
    <p class="text-bg-secondary">
        print('Hello, World')</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Python 2.x Version ≥ 2.6</strong></p>

        <p>You can use the Python 3 print function in Python 2 with the following import statement:</p>
<p class="text-bg-secondary">from p__future__ import print_function </p>
<p>Python 2 has a number of functionalities that can be optionally imported from Python 3 using the __future__
module, as discussed here. <br><br>
Python 2.x Version ≤ 2.7    <br><br>
If using Python 2, you may also type the line below. Note that this is not valid in Python 3 and thus not
recommended because it reduces cross-version code compatibility.</p>
<p class="text-bg-secondary">print 'Hello, World'</p>
<p>
In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file <tt> hello.py</tt> <br>
Type python hello.py, then hit the Enter key. </p>
<p class="text-bg-secondary">
$ python hello.py <br>
Hello, World</p>
<p>
You should see Hello, World printed to the console. <br> <br>
You can also substitute hello.py with the path to your file. For example, if you have the file in your home directory
and your user is "user" on Linux, you can type python /home/user/hello.py.
</p>

<h1 class="text-bg-success">Section 1.2: Creating variables and assigning values</h1>
<p class="">To create a variable in Python, all you need to do is specify the variable name, and then assign a value to it. <br>
    &lt;variable name &gt; = &lt; value &gt; <br> <br>
    Python uses = to assign values to variables. There's no need to declare a variable in advance (or to assign a data
    type to it), assigning a value to a variable itself declares and initializes the variable with that value. There's no way to
    declare a variable without assigning it an initial value.</p>

    <code>
        # Integer <br>
        a = 2<br>
        print(a)<br>
        # Output: 2<br>
        # Integer <br>
        b = 9223372036854775807<br>
        print(b)<br>
        # Output: 9223372036854775807<br>
        # Floating point<br>
        pi = 3.14<br>
        print(pi)<br>
        # Output: 3.14<br>
        # String<br>
        c = 'A'<br>
        print(c)<br>
        # Output: A<br>
        # String <br>
        name = 'John Doe'<br>
        print(name)<br>
        # Output: John Doe<br>
        # Boolean <br>
        q = True<br>
        print(q)<br>
        # Output: True<br>
        # Empty value or null data type<br>
        x = None<br>
        print(x)<br>
        # Output: None</code><br> <br>
        <p>Variable assignment works from left to right. So the following will give you an syntax error.</p>
        <code>
            0 = x <br>
=> Output: SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
        </code> <br><br>
        <p>You can not use python's keywords as a valid variable name. You can see the list of keyword by:</p>
        <p class="text-bg-secondary">import keyword <br>
            print(keyword.kwlist)</p>
            <h6 class="text-bg-danger">Rules for variable naming:</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>Variables names must start with a letter or an underscore. <br> <br>
<code>
    x = True # valid <br>
    _y = True # valid <br>
    9x = False # starts with numeral<br>
   => SyntaxError: invalid syntax <br>
    $y = False # starts with symbol<br>
   => SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
</code>
</li> <br>
<li>The remainder of your variable name may consist of letters, numbers and underscores. <br> <br>
    <code>has_0_in_it = "Still Valid"</code>
</li> <br> <br>
<li>Names are case sensitive. <br> <br>
    <code>x = 9 <br>
        y = X*5 <br>
        =>NameError: name 'X' is not defined <br>
    </code>
</li>
            </ol>

<p class="text-bg-success">Even though there's no need to specify a data type when declaring a variable in Python, while allocating the
    necessary area in memory for the variable, the Python interpreter automatically picks the most suitable built-in
    type for it:</p>
    <code>
        a = 2 <br>
print(type(a)) <br>
# Output: &lt;type 'int'&gt; <br>
b = 9223372036854775807 <br>
print(type(b)) <br>
# Output: &lt;type 'int'&gt; <br>
pi = 3.14 <br>
print(type(pi)) <br>
# Output: &lt;type 'float'&gt; <br>
c = 'A' <br>
print(type(c)) <br>
# Output: &lt;type 'str'&gt; <br>
name = 'John Doe' <br>
print(type(name)) <br>
# Output: &lt;type 'str'&gt; <br>
q = True <br>
print(type(q)) <br>

# Output: &lt;type 'bool'&gt; <br>
x = None <br>
print(type(x)) <br>
# Output: &lt;type 'NoneType'&gt; <br>
    </code> <br> <br>
    <p class="text-bg-info">
        Now you know the basics of assignment, let's get this subtlety about assignment in python out of the way. <br> <br>
When you use = to do an assignment operation, what's on the left of = is a <strong> name </strong>for the <strong> object</strong> on the right. Finally,
what = does is assign the <strong> reference</strong> of the object on the right to the <strong> name</strong> on the left. <br> <br>
That is:
    </p>
            <code>
                a_name = an_object # "a_name" is now a name for the reference to the object "an_object"
            </code>
            <br><br>
            <p>So, from many assignment examples above, if we pick pi = 3.14, then pi is a name (not the name, since an object
                can have multiple names) for the object 3.14. If you don't understand something below, come back to this point
                and read this again! Also, you can take a look at this for a better understanding.
                You can assign multiple values to multiple variables in one line. Note that there must be the same number of
                arguments on the right and left sides of the = operator:</p>

                <br> <br>
                <code>
                    a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 <br>
print(a, b, c) <br>
# Output: 1 2 3 <br>
a, b, c = 1, 2 <br>
=> Traceback (most recent call last): <br>
=> File "name.py", line N, in &lt;module&gt; <br>
=> a, b, c = 1, 2 <br>
=> ValueError: need more than 2 values to unpack
a, b = 1, 2, 3 <br>
=> Traceback (most recent call last): <br>
=> File "name.py", line N, in &lt;module&gt; <br>
=> a, b = 1, 2, 3 <br>
=> ValueError: too many values to unpack <br>
                </code>

                <br> <br>

               <p> The error in last example can be obviated by assigning remaining values to equal number of arbitrary variables.
                This dummy variable can have any name, but it is conventional to use the underscore (_) for assigning unwanted
                values:</p>
                <code>
                a, b, _ = 1, 2, 3 <br>
                print(a, b) <br>
                # Output: 1, 2 <br>
            </code>
                <p>Note that the number of _ and number of remaining values must be equal. Otherwise 'too many values to unpack
                error' is thrown as above:</p>
                <code>
                a, b, _ = 1,2,3,4 <br>
                =>Traceback (most recent call last): <br>
                =>File "name.py", line N, in &lt;module&gt; <br>
                =>a, b, _ = 1,2,3,4 <br>
                =>ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)
            </code> <br><br>
            <p>
                You can also assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.</p>
<code>
                a = b = c = 1 <br>
                print(a, b, c) <br>
                # Output: 1 1 1 <br>
            </code>
            <br>
            <p>
                When using such cascading assignment, it is important to note that all three variables a, b and c refer to the same
                object in memory, an int object with the value of 1. In other words, a, b and c are three different names given to the
                same int object. Assigning a different object to one of them afterwards doesn't change the others, just as expected:</p>
                <code>
                a = b = c = 1 # all three names a, b and c refer to same int object with value 1 <br>
                print(a, b, c)
                # Output: 1 1 1 <br>
                b = 2 # b now refers to another int object, one with a value of 2 <br>
                print(a, b, c) <br>
                # Output: 1 2 1 # so output is as expected.</code>
                <br> <br>
                <p>The above is also true for mutable types (like list, dict, etc.) just as it is true for immutable types (like int, string,
                tuple, etc.):</p>
                <code>
                x = y = [7, 8, 9] # x and y refer to the same list object just created, [7, 8, 9] <br>
                x = [13, 8, 9] # x now refers to a different list object just created, [13, 8, 9] <br>
                print(y) # y still refers to the list it was first assigned
                # Output: [7, 8, 9]
            </code>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                So far so good. Things are a bit different when it comes to modifying the object (in contrast to assigning the name to
                a different object, which we did above) when the cascading assignment is used for mutable types. Take a look
                below, and you will see it first hand: </p>
                <code>
                x = y = [7, 8, 9] # x and y are two different names for the same list object just created, [7,
                8, 9] <br>
                x[0] = 13 # we are updating the value of the list [7, 8, 9] through one of its names, x
                in this case <br>
                print(y) # printing the value of the list using its other name <br>
                # Output: [13, 8, 9] # hence, naturally the change is reflected
            </code>
            <br>
            <br>
               <p> Nested lists are also valid in python. This means that a list can contain another list as an element. </p>
               <code>
                x = [1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6, 7] #  this is nested list
                print x[2] <br>
                # Output: [3, 4, 5]
                print x[2][1] <br>
                # Output: 4 </code>
               <p> Lastly, variables in Python do not have to stay the same type as which they were first defined -- you can simply use
                = to assign a new value to a variable, even if that value is of a different type. </p>
                <code>
                a = 2 <br>
                print(a) <br>
                # Output: 2 <br>
                a = "New value" <br>
                print(a) <br>
                # Output: New value </code>
                <br> <br>
               <p> If this bothers you, think about the fact that what's on the left of = is just a name for an object. First you call the int
                object with value 2 a, then you change your mind and decide to give the name a to a string object, having value
                'New value'. Simple, right? </p>
